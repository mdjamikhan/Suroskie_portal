# Testing

## Running the tests

```bash
# One-time: a dedicated test database (never point tests at dev/prod; the harness refuses other names)
createdb suroskie_test
export TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASS@localhost:5432/suroskie_test?schema=public"   # optional; this is the default URL

npm run test:unit          # pure logic, no database (~2 s)
npm run test:integration   # real Postgres: scoping, aggregation, sync pipeline vs. mock Meta, users, exports (~10 s)
npm run test:e2e           # next build + next start + mock Meta, full acceptance workflow over HTTP (~1–2 min)
npm test                   # everything
```

`E2E_SKIP_BUILD=1 npm run test:e2e` reuses an existing `.next` build. `E2E_VERBOSE=1` shows server logs. CI is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and runs type-check, lint and all three suites against a Postgres 16 service.

### About the Meta mock

`tests/mock-meta/server.ts` is a local stand-in for the documented Graph API endpoints the sync uses: `debug_token`, `me`, `me/adaccounts`, campaigns/ad sets/ads with cursor pagination, creative lookup by ids, async insights reports with polling, and breakdowns. It **rejects** requests without the Bearer token or a valid `appsecret_proof`, and it can inject failures: expired token (190), rate limit (80004 with usage headers), transient 500, rejected field (100), failed async job, and attribution changes.

Passing tests show the integration logic is correct against the documented API contract. They do **not** show live connectivity to Meta. See the "First live run" checklist in [META_SETUP.md](META_SETUP.md).

## Latest results

Run on 2026-10-28, Node 22, PostgreSQL 16, Next.js 16.4.3 production build:

```
 Test Files  11 passed (11)
      Tests  148 passed (148)
```

Type-check (`tsc --noEmit`): clean. ESLint: 0 errors, 3 warnings (intentional full-page navigation after sign-out; unused parameter names in a test mock).

### Coverage by requirement

| Requirement | Where it's tested |
|---|---|
| Authentication (sign-in, wrong password, no public sign-up, invitation flow, password rules) | e2e acceptance 1, 5–7; integration admin › invitations |
| Role-based access and privilege escalation | unit access; integration admin › "non-super-admins cannot grant…" |
| Creator-level restrictions | integration reporting-scope › creator-level restrictions; e2e 7–9 |
| Metric visibility (projection, hidden-metric sorting, exports) | integration reporting-scope; integration admin › exports; e2e 9 |
| API authorization and direct URL access | e2e 9 (other creator IDs, `creator=` injection, compare, admin APIs, page URLs), security controls |
| Data aggregation, ROAS and CPA | unit metrics; integration reporting-scope › aggregation accuracy; e2e 8 |
| Date filtering and date permissions | unit date-range; integration reporting-scope (inclusive ranges, clamping) |
| Duplicate prevention and idempotency | integration sync-pipeline › idempotent re-sync, dedupe; admin › one creator per ad |
| Meta API failures | unit meta-client; integration sync-pipeline › failure handling |
| Export permissions | integration admin › exports; e2e 9 (403) and CSV download |
| Demo isolation | integration reporting-scope › "never mixes demo data" |
| Suspension, CSRF, rate limiting, security headers, audit log | e2e security controls |

### Added for the real-Meta go-live (18 tests)

* `tests/integration/access-matrix.test.ts`: custom role limited to one ad account and two metrics (including its CSV export), a marketing manager's campaign export limited to assigned accounts, the "no data before" date, granting a metric beyond the role, denying a report the role includes, the "all creators" override, and demo rows never leaking into a scoped user's report.
* `tests/integration/sync-pipeline.test.ts` ("real-Meta hardening"): a bad creative id inside a batch, page-size reduction, the 37-month retention error, the backfill start date, proactive token expiry, and `appsecret_proof` on `debug_token`.
* `tests/unit/meta-client.test.ts`: page-size halving without same-size retries; the insights throttle header.
* `tests/e2e/acceptance.test.ts` ("Facebook Login (OAuth) connection"): the dialog redirect (client id, redirect URI, scopes, state cookie), a forged state rejected, the code exchange creating an encrypted connection, and a non-admin blocked.

The full list below predates these additions.

### Bugs the tests caught during development

* The creatives CSV export applied the leaderboard's minimum-spend threshold and silently dropped rows. Fixed: exports include every row unless a threshold is passed explicitly.
* A client component imported a module that transitively imported the database client. The production build failed. Fixed by moving client-safe constants out, and `db.ts` now imports `server-only` so this fails loudly in future.
