# Delivery checklist

Legend:

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Implemented **and** covered by automated tests |
| 🟢 | Implemented; checked manually in the browser, no dedicated automated test |
| 🟡 | Implemented, but depends on external configuration not available during the build (Meta credentials, SMTP, hosting) |
| ⏳ | Not implemented |

## Core workflow (acceptance criteria)

| 3 | Imports campaigns, ad sets, ads and performance | ✅ against mock · 🟡 live Meta |
| 4 | Admin maps ads to creators | ✅ |
| 5 | Admin invites a content team member | ✅ (link shown to admin) · 🟡 email delivery needs SMTP |
| 6 | Assigns selected creators and specific metrics | ✅ |
| 7 | Member signs in and searches for an authorised creator | ✅ |
| 8 | Accurate, date-filtered performance from synced data | ✅ |
| 9 | Cannot reach other creators' data or restricted metrics via API, URL or exports | ✅ |
| 10 | Automatic refresh and last-successful-sync display | ✅ (cron endpoints tested) · 🟡 GitHub Actions secrets and schedule need production setup |

| **Deliverables** | Source, schema and migrations, seed, `.env.example`, Dockerfile, CI, `vercel.json`, docs | ✅ |

## Pending or not implemented

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| ⏳ Live verification against Meta | Needs your Meta app credentials and a token. Follow Parts A–E of GO_LIVE.md. Only verified live so far: Meta accepts the Bearer token header. |
| ⏳ PDF reports | CSV only. Any future PDF should reuse `buildExport()` to keep the same access rules. |
| ⏳ Multi-creator split attribution | Each ad credits exactly one creator, by design. Splitting credit (for example collaborations) would need a share column on `ad_creator_mapping`. |
| ⏳ Two-factor authentication | Better Auth offers a 2FA plugin; recommended for Super Admins. |
| ⏳ Embedded video playback | Thumbnails plus Meta's shareable preview link. No in-app video player. |
| ⏳ Automated browser (UI) tests | UI checked manually with Playwright screenshots; tests cover services and HTTP. |

## Known limitations

1. **Reach and frequency** are only exact for a single ad on a single day. Meta de-duplicates reach, so the portal shows summed daily reach labelled `≤` (upper bound), and frequency as a lower bound.
2. **Time zones:** Meta reports days in the ad account's time zone. The reporting time zone controls "today" and the presets but can't re-bucket Meta's daily rows. A notice appears when they differ.
3. **"Unsupported metric" flags are global**, not per ad account.
4. **Structure sync lists all campaigns, ad sets and ads every hour.** That's fine for typical accounts. Very large accounts (tens of thousands of ads) would benefit from `updated_time` filtering.
5. **Sample-size warnings are heuristics** (minimum spend, purchases and impressions), not statistical significance tests.
6. **Exports are capped at 10,000 rows** per file.
7. **Sign-in rate limiting is keyed by client IP** from `X-Forwarded-For`. Deploy behind a proxy that sets it correctly.
8. **Results** come from the optimisation goal. Goals the portal doesn't recognise show results as unavailable rather than guessing.
9. **Breakdown reports** cover spend, impressions, reach, clicks, link clicks, purchases and value. Video metrics aren't broken down.
10. **Demo mode** is instance-wide. Demo creators (codes `DEMO-…`) are stored alongside real creators and have no data in real mode. Run `npm run demo:clear` before going live.
